Converted to use org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver.

I simply did not want to waste time on postgresql right now. 
I wanted to see clojure work.

The application has been changed a bit to reflect current state of clojure development. Refer to project.clj for further information.

## Usage

lein run script/run.clj

or

lein swank (or M-x swank-clojure-project in emacs)

and in the resulting repl

(load-file "script/run.clj")

## Installation

lein deps
